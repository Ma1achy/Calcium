// The arm seam, mutated — C12 I59, I61, I64, I65, §3ak.7.
//
// **One run for the seam rather than one per family**, because the families
// share the decisions and differ only in the marks: `positionalDecisions` is
// mutated once and every family that reads it is under the same row. Named for
// the seam and not the curve for that reason — it grows as the seven land.
//
// **The pass's own claim is what is under test here.** Step 3 says `figureOf`
// is the terminal's computation *moved*, so a decision changed inside it must
// change the terminal's frame — and where it does not, the member has no
// consumer yet and that is F84's class rather than a licence.
//
// **Two rows are about the seam and not about a renderer.** The `orientation`
// and run-break rows mutate a shared decision that the terminal reads *through*
// its own rasteriser, which is the only place a shared layer can be wrong in a
// way both arms agree about.
//
// **Stated survivor, so an unrecorded limit does not read as strength.**
// `Figure.frame` is not mutated: `definition.ts` still applies `block.plotFrame`
// to the layout directly, so nothing reads the member and a mutation on it would
// fail nothing by construction. It closes when the SVG walks the figure.
