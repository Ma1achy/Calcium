# docker-tui — findings

What the first consumer found, in the shape Calcium recorded its own: **the surface that
needed it**, **what was reached for**, and **whether it is adapter-side work or a real
Calcium finding**.

Nothing here is fixed in Calcium by this app. R01's premise is that a framework change
arrives with a consumer proving it was needed — so the app absorbs what it can, records
what it absorbed, and the framework moves later with this file as the argument.

## F1 — Calcium assumes the far side accepts `--json`, and docker does not ★

| | |
|---|---|
| **Surface** | S2 `/ps` — the first invocation of anything |
| **Reached for** | any way to say what the far side's JSON flag is called |
| **Verdict** | **a real Calcium finding**, absorbed app-side for now |
| **Absorbed by** | `bin/docker-json`, and `binary` pointing at it |

`src/data/transport/argv.ts` appends `--json` unconditionally:

```
$ docker ps --json
unknown flag: --json
```

Docker wants `docker ps --format json`.

**It is a premise, not a line.** `withJson` is imported by the subprocess, emulated and
fixture transports; C23 reads `argv.includes("--json")` to decide `userRequestedJson`;
C06 §3 and C07 §4 both document the flag as the contract. *The far side speaks `--json`*
is something the framework is built on rather than something it configures.

R01 §2 chose docker because containers are **not Prism-shaped** — "a Prism concept quietly
absorbed into the framework surfaces here, visibly". This is that row paying off on the
first contact with a real far side, before a line of app code.

**What a fix would look like**, when one is argued: the flag belongs beside `binary` on
`TuiConfig`, because it is a property of the far side the app author is the only party who
can know — the same reasoning C05 uses for `ToolDef.interactive`. Detection is not
available and a list of known CLIs would fail silently for every wrapper.

**How it closes:** `bin/docker-json` is deleted and `binary` goes back to `"docker"`. The
file is the finding; its deletion is the finding closing.

## F2 — Calcium was not a publishable package, and CI had a job that proved nothing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Surface** | the proof gate (R01 §8), before it could be written |
| **Reached for** | `npm publish` into a local registry |
| **Verdict** | **a real Calcium finding** — fixed in Calcium, because the app cannot absorb it |

`package.json` carried `"private": true`, and `npm publish` refuses a private package
outright. R01 commitment 9 rests the whole monorepo arrangement on a pack-and-install gate,
and that gate could never have run.

**The sharper half:** `ci.yml` already had a `publish` job. It is tag-gated, so it had never
executed, and it could not have succeeded if it had. A release path that has never run reads
exactly like one that works — A03 §2's vacuity class arriving in CI rather than in a rule.

Fixed by `chore/package-identity` (PR #13) rather than absorbed, because there is no app-side
version of "the package can be published".

**And one that would have bitten the gate:** `publishConfig.registry` beats a `--registry`
flag. A dry run pointed at `localhost:4873` published to `npm.pkg.github.com` regardless. The
Verdaccio step must override `publishConfig`, not merely pass a registry.

## F3 — R01's own premise about docker has expired

| | |
|---|---|
| **Surface** | S2 `/ps` — the adapter's coercion boundary |
| **Reached for** | R01 §4's table of what docker emits |
| **Verdict** | **adapter-side work**, plus a small R01 correction |

R01 §4 says *"Everything is a string, including numbers"*. Docker 29.4.1 does not agree:

```json
"Platform": {"architecture": "arm64", "os": "linux"}
```

A nested object, in the middle of an otherwise flat record.

**And docker pre-truncates its own fields**, with U+2026:

```json
"Mounts": "/host_mnt/User…"
```

That one is the hazard rather than the curiosity. `cells()` measures `…` as one cell, so a
field docker has already shortened, rendered into a column narrower than it, is truncated
**twice** and shows two ellipses. It is the class where *a value belongs to the far side and
the code assumes it owns it* — invisible until a real far side that pre-truncates arrives,
which is the first thing this app did.

R01 §4's row wants rewording: docker's values are strings *except where they are not*, and
the far side changed under the spec, which is the argument R01 makes about docker made
against R01.

## Open, not yet reached

Recorded so their absence is a decision. Each gets an entry above when the surface that
needs it is built.

- **Gap 7 — a `b.live` part hosted by a pushed view** (S3). The driver's `view` host arm,
  specified and shipped tested against an entry host only. The most valuable thing this app
  can surface, and step 3 reaches it.
- **Gap 3 — value-colour vs tone-colour.** A CPU bar encodes load on a continuum; Calcium's
  palette is tone slots. Step 2.
- **Gap 1 — history across ticks.** `b.live` re-renders from the latest fetch; a sparkline
  needs the previous values. Adapter ring-buffer first.
- **The line budget.** R01 commitment 1 caps app code at 300 lines. Exceeding it is a
  finding *about Calcium* — it means the app had to write something generic itself — so if
  it goes over, the lines that pushed it over get named here rather than the budget raised.
